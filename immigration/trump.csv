Muslim Public Affairs Council,religpew==6,Kellianne D,"It existed once, but doesn't any longer",,,,"Once again, the Trump administration has decided to play politics over creating sound policy. Today, the Trump administration announced the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Starting today, the fate of 800,000 young people are now uncertain. These are young individuals who call America home and contribute to our society. The Trump administration continues to promote xenophobic and anti-American policies. We call on Congress to pass legislation that protects DREAMers and provide a pathway to citizenship. The Trump administration continues to pass shameful policies. They are targeting some of the most vulnerable of society -- young people, and the fact that the decision to terminate this program has been made, continues to show that this administration is not a champion for American values. We will continue to work with and urge Congress to pass commonsense comprehensive immigration reform including legislation to preserve DACA.",https://www.mpac.org/blog/trumps-decision-to-terminate-daca-is-cruel.php
American Baptist Church,religpew_baptist==2,Nick Zaris,Yes,Yes,No,No,"Recent actions and statements of the Trump administration toward Dreamers reflect poorly on the United States as a nation of immigrants that extends hospitality, liberty, opportunity and justice to all people. Our inherent values must not be left to the president and attorney general to define for all Americans. People of faith and goodwill from all walks of life are called upon to advocate and inform public discourse about the importance of love, welcome, hospitality and caring for strangers without causing harm. “President Trump’s decision to rescind DACA, effective in six months, causes undue fear, insecurity, risk and threats of deportation to our neighbors who are contributing to society as students, workers, public servants, faith leaders and more,” says Dr. Jeffrey Haggray, ABHMS executive director and director of Public Witness and Advocacy. “To think that many of the same persons who are actively participating in rescue efforts of vulnerable Americans without regard for race, gender, creed, citizenship or any other identifier would suddenly become at risk for deportation, simply because they are childhood immigrants, raises serious questions about our basic values of decency, humanity and civility.” ABHMS urges all people of faith and goodwill to lobby congressional representatives to make DACA’s provisions permanent for all Dreamers.",http://www.abc-usa.org/2017/09/08/american-baptist-home-mission-societies-calls-on-congress-to-protect-dreamers/
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship,,Paul Djupe,Yes,Yes,No,No,"This has been a trial program testing criteria that is given for a successful immigration program — speaking English, maintaining employment and contributing to the greater good of the United States. It has exceeded every criterion that we’ve ever looked at for successful immigration. The fact that President Trump won’t maintain it is a mistake. Now, Congress has the opportunity to take a proven program that has a positive outcome and make it a sustained program.”",https://thinkprogress.org/faith-groups-overwhelmingly-condemn-trumps-decision-to-phase-out-daca-4d3db0f3dd50/
Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR),,Kyle Mares,Yes,Yes,No,No,"“The American Muslim community and CAIR stand with the 800,000 undocumented young people who were brought to our nation as children, who call the United States home and whose only dream is to come out of the shadows and to stay where they belong.
“By terminating DACA, even with a six-month delay or ‘wind down,’ President Trump is pandering to the demands of anti-immigrant extremists and harming our nation by targeting some of the most dynamic and success-oriented members of society. In practical terms, the ‘delay’ in implementing the termination is meaningless for the vast majority of Dreamers and will inevitably result in chaos in their lives.
“These young Dreamers deserve the chance to work and study -- and to be protected from deportation -- while Congress debates broader legislation to fix our broken immigration system.
“President Trump’s heartless action will only serve to create fear and anxiety for the Dreamers and their loved ones, and will force them back to living in the shadows, rendering them unable to contribute to our nation’s economy.
“CAIR encourages state and local officials across the nation to enact policies prohibiting discrimination based on citizenship status and to offer sanctuary and support for Dreamers.
“American Muslims will continue to push for measures that protect undocumented youth and support comprehensive immigration reform – reform that includes a roadmap to citizenship for the nation's 11 million undocumented residents.”

NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice,,Paul Djupe,Yes,Yes,No,No,"Immigrant and refugee families are part of the fabric of our community – full members of our schools, our workplaces, and our places of worship. Our faith calls us to value, welcome, and protect families, not to tear them apart. NETWORK Lobby opposes the actions taken today by the Trump Administration. They are mean-spirited and fail to recognize the dignity of our immigrant sisters and brothers. We look to Congress to uphold family values by protecting DREAMers AND their families. Congress must take the reasonable road by implementing the safeguards our communities need in an unstable Trump presidency.”",https://thinkprogress.org/faith-groups-overwhelmingly-condemn-trumps-decision-to-phase-out-daca-4d3db0f3dd50/
Unitarian-Universality Association (UUA),,Cesar Barraza,Yes,Yes,No,No,"“As leaders in faith and human rights, and working jointly through the Love Resists campaign to protect communities targeted by hate, we are appalled by the Trump administration’s announcement to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. DACA has provided protections from deportations and the ability to work and attend school for more than 800,000 young immigrants. The United States is home to these brave people.

Taking away DREAMers’ legal status and leaving them vulnerable to deportation is immoral and wrong. DREAMers are not bargaining chips to be used for political gain, and the further criminalization and persecution of the broader immigrant community is disgraceful. These individuals are not statistics; they are students, doctors, and veterans, they are hard-working members and leaders of communities, they are parents, friends, neighbors and loved ones. Tearing our communities apart makes no one safer.

We raise our voices in outrage at the President’s betrayal of DREAMers so that he may receive accolades and applause from the alt-right and other white supremacist groups. This action goes against our nation’s principles and the views and wishes of the majority of the country. We are in solidarity with all DREAMers now facing a nightmare of uncertainty because of today’s announcement. We encourage Unitarian Universalists and all people of faith and conscience to rise up and resist this latest attack on our immigrant siblings.

To all those directly affected by this decision, we recognize your humanity. You are part of the United States. We will defend your right to stay. We will continue to resist with you in the spirit of love and freedom.”",https://www.uua.org/pressroom/press-releases/uua-uusc-leaders-are-appalled-decision-end-daca
